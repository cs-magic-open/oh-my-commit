- Identified potential causes for 'No changes' display:
  1. stagedFiles data source issue (localStorage sync)
  2. File selection logic (lastOpenedFilePath)
  3. diff content processing (optional diff field)
- Examined related files:
  - DiffViewer.tsx: Main component logic
  - commit.changed-files.ts: State management

- Found root cause in extension code:
  1. In quick-commit.ts, transformFiles function hardcodes additions and deletions to 0
  2. Git diff content not properly set in FileChange objects
  3. Need to properly integrate git diff information with FileChange objects
- Affected files:
  - quick-commit.ts: File transformation logic
  - git.ts: Git operations

- Implemented fixes in multiple files:
  1. quick-commit.ts:
     - Updated transformFiles to use diff summary information
     - Added proper file change tracking
  2. git.ts:
     - Enhanced getStagedDiff and getUnstagedDiff to return both content and summary
     - Improved error handling
  3. vscode-command.ts:
     - Added isStaged field to FileChange interface
- Changes ensure proper tracking and display of file changes
