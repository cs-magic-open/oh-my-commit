### UI Enhancement: Professional File Status Indicators

**Problem:**
- File change indicators in `FileChanges.tsx` were not professional enough
- Used VSCode Codicons which took up more space and were less familiar to Git users

**Solution:**
- Replaced icons with Git-style single-letter status indicators:
  - A (Added)
  - M (Modified)
  - D (Deleted)
  - R (Renamed)
  - ? (Unknown)
- Added tooltips for better UX
- Used monospace font and centered alignment for clean presentation
- Maintained existing color scheme for consistency

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/webview-ui/src/components/commit/FileChanges.tsx`
  - Replaced `STATUS_ICONS` with `STATUS_LETTERS`
  - Updated status display in all view modes (flat, grouped, tree)
  - Added tooltips using original status labels

**Notes:**
- The change brings the UI closer to Git's own status representation
- Improves space efficiency while maintaining clarity
- Familiar to experienced Git users while still being accessible to newcomers through tooltips

### UI Enhancement: Improved File List Interaction

**Problem:**
- Checkbox clickable area was too small
- Excessive spacing between file entries
- Overall layout could be more compact

**Solution:**
- Expanded clickable area for checkboxes to full height (22px)
- Optimized layout spacing and padding
- Improved interaction areas:
  - Made entire row clickable for file selection
  - Added dedicated wide checkbox area (24px)
  - Maintained visual separation while reducing gaps
- Added hover effect for checkbox area

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/webview-ui/src/components/commit/FileChanges.tsx`
  - Restructured file item layout
  - Optimized padding and spacing
  - Enhanced click handlers and event propagation

**Notes:**
- Better touch targets improve usability
- More efficient use of vertical space
- Smoother interaction with clear visual feedback

### UI Enhancement: Simplified File List Interaction 

**Problem:**
- File list interactions were complex with multiple click handlers
- Checkbox area had separate click handling logic
- Overall interaction model needed simplification

**Solution:**
- Unified click handling at the row level:
  - Normal click: Toggle file expansion
  - Cmd/Ctrl + click: Toggle file selection
- Simplified checkbox implementation:
  - Made checkbox purely presentational (readOnly)
  - Removed separate click handlers
  - Maintained visual feedback
- Optimized layout:
  - Consistent 32px row height
  - Clear visual hierarchy
  - Efficient space usage

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/webview-ui/src/components/commit/FileChanges.tsx`
  - Simplified event handling logic
  - Unified interaction model
  - Improved code organization

**Notes:**
- More intuitive and predictable behavior
- Reduced code complexity while maintaining functionality
- Better aligned with standard UI patterns

### UI Enhancement: Improved File Selection Logic 

**Problem:**
- File selection behavior wasn't intuitive
- Checkbox state wasn't always in sync with file active state
- Click handling was overly complex

**Solution:**
- Improved file selection logic:
  - Clicking non-active file: Select and activate
  - Clicking active file: Deselect and deactivate
  - Cmd/Ctrl + click: Toggle selection with activation
- Synchronized states:
  - Checkbox state always matches file active state
  - Added state validation during rendering
  - Unified selection and activation handling
- Simplified event handlers:
  - Consolidated click handling logic
  - Clear separation of normal vs. Cmd/Ctrl click behavior
  - Removed redundant event handlers

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/webview-ui/src/components/commit/FileChanges.tsx`
  - Refactored `handleFileClick` and `handleFileSelect`
  - Added state synchronization
  - Improved code organization

**Notes:**
- More predictable and intuitive behavior
- Better state management
- Improved code maintainability
